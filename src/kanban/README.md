# Kanban board
###What is here

Trello app for poor people.
To create boards in which you can create tasks.

### How to run
This is a module-based project.
Launch the project folder on your local machine.
I recommend setting up  [Node static server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/static-server "Node static server"). It is a simple http server to serve static resource files from a local directory.

**You can also run index.html in any browser, but most likely the scripts will not work due to browser security rules.**

### What is inside
The **src** folder contains folders with images, styles for components, and scripts.

### Example
